As you know, I am not a Windows person. A Linux user for years, after going through multiple flavors of Debian, now my thing is `OpenSuse Tumbleweed`_. But I also have a Windows 7 work computer that I use occasionally.
For that, MobaXterm_ comes in very handy.

MobaXterm_ is a set of very interesting applications to work as in Linux and connect to remote computers:
terminal, ssh client, X server, rdp, vnc, etc.
