Reading my RSS feeds I just came across a very useful tool. It is `pgcli`_ which is nothing more than a
command line interface for Postgres with auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
Since I use the console with databases, and postgres is always my first choice,
it comes in handy. with auto-completion and syntax highlighting

I recommend installing it via `pipsi`_.
