I've been testing `insync`_ for several days and I think I'll happily pay for it.

.. _insync: https://www.insynchq.com/

I downloaded two packages, one for the dolphin context menu and another (the fedora one) for the program itself::

    20:39 $ rpm -qa | grep insync
    insync-1.2.7.35123-fc20.x86_64
    insync-dolphin-1.2.7.35123-fc17.noarch

Everything working perfectly on my opensuse
