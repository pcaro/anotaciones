:summary: Stop firefox from opening the pasted url with the middle mouse button

Another reminder note.
I usually open links in a new window in firefox using the middle button.
It often happens to me that I have a url in the clipboard and firefox then opens it for me instead of the link.
To avoid this, simply go to :code:`about:config` and set the property :code:`middlemouse.contentLoadURL` to false.
