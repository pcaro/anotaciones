As I said, Google announced the closure of Google Code.

Today I received the email notifying me (I had a test project hosted there) that I could move
my projects simply to `github`_, the de facto repository for free software today
(sorry for `bitbucket`_ and especially for `mercurial`_).

.. _mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/

.. _bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/pcaro

.. _github: http://github.com

Its interface was never the friendliest, nor did it achieve great popularity, but there are still interesting projects
in Google Code that I suppose will move to github or die forever.
